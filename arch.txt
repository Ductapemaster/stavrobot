Stavrobot is a TypeScript/Node.js HTTP server that wraps an LLM-powered conversational agent (Anthropic Claude) with persistent PostgreSQL storage and multi-channel messaging capabilities. The system runs as five Docker containers: the main app (exposing a POST /chat endpoint with tools for SQL execution, memory management, web search, TTS, cron scheduling, and messaging), PostgreSQL (storing conversation history, memories, and dynamically-created pages), a tool-runner (a Node.js server that manages and executes custom tools stored as directories with manifest files), a coder container (a Python server wrapping the Claude CLI binary that enables the agent to self-program by creating or editing custom tools), and a Signal bridge (a Python process forwarding messages between Signal and the main app). External messages arrive via Telegram webhooks or Signal bridge, get enqueued for processing by the LLM agent, which can invoke tools and respond through the same channel; the coder container enables self-modification by using Claude Code to edit tools in a shared volume.
